This is a gameserver that im making in my spare time.

there are lot of thing's todo, for example have the players issue commands to the server.

To run this program

first 
download this repo with git clone 

`git clone https://github.com/JereUjala/Gameserver_cpp.git`

run `make`

and execute server with a port as an argument. If a port is not given the default port of 1512 is used

`./bin/server 88`

Note: 
     I have only tested this on linux.
